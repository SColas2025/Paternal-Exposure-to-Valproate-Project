# Paternal-Exposure-to-Valproate-Project
GitHub repository containing SAS codes for generating numerical results and statistical estimates presented in the publication: **"Paternal Valproate Use and Neurodevelopmental Disorder and Congenital Malformation Risk in Offspring"**. JAMA Netw Open. Published November 10, 2025. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.42581. 

In this study, we evaluated the association between paternal exposure to valproate and neurodevelopmental disorder or congenital malformation risk in children.

### Input data

The analyses performed by the SAS code in this repository are based on a dataset described in the file "01_data_description.docx". This input dataset used in the SAS-code is created separately for each country (Sweden, Denmark, Norway) by combining data from multiple National registers within that country.
